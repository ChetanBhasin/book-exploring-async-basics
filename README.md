# The Node Experiment - Exploring Async Basics with Rust

This book aims to take a look at the **why** and **how** of concurrent programming. First we build
a good foundation of basic knowledge, before we use that knowledge to investigate how Node.js works
by building a Node-inspired runtime. 

The rendered version can be found here: [The Node Experiment - Exploring Async Basics with Rust](https://cfsamson.github.io/book-exploring-async-basics/).
