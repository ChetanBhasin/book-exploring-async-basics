# Investigating Async Basics by Implementing the Node Eventloop in Rust Book

This is the repo for the book. It aims to be a good Async primer and will also demystify a bit of what the eventloop in Node is all about.

## Building
You'll need to install [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook) to build this book for yourself. 

Then you can build and open the book:
``` 
mdbook build --open
```
