# Conclusion

Congratulations!!

What a ride, huh? We're finished, take a break and get som fresh air. You've deserved
it.

We did cover a lot in this book in a fairly condensed manner. I hope I kept my
initial promise of what we were going to learn and that you also got something
usefull out of this.

Anyway, I want to thank you for reading all the way to the end, and I really do hope you enjoyed it.

Feel free to visit the repository of this book. I would love to hear from you
if you think there is improvements I could make or if you just found it a good read.

Until next time!
